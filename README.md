# Optical-Character-Recognition-and-TTS 
-> Text acquisition, recognition and speech conversion using character recognition approach and text to speech synthesizer (TTS)  by MATLAB.

-> The main objective of the project is to extract horizontally aligned text of various font styles including hand written from images.

-> The code electronically converts hand written or printed text into machine encoded text from a scanned document or a photo.

# Applications
